Simple PostScript Interpretor

This was an assignment that I'm proud of from my Computer Science 355 Languages class at Washington
State University. The assignment was to build a python program that could run text files from command
line as though they were post script. Because it was a simple project, this code only implements basic 
PostScript functionality.

It ended up receiving a grade of 97/100 because of a spelling error in the division function that would 
cause a python interpreter error.

Spelling is not my strongest skillâ€¦

To run, simply run "python3 sps.py sample.txt" from terminal to run the interpreter on the PS in sample.txt.
